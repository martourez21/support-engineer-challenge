Dear Tommy,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the issue with your app. 
I understand how important it is for your app to function correctly and I am here to help.

From the information you have provided, it seems that your app is failing to deploy due to unhealthy allocations. I would like to ask a few questions to get a better understanding of the issue:

   Have there been any recent changes to the app?
   Are there any error messages in the app's monitoring logs concerning this issue?
   Have you tried rolling back to a previous version of the app?

Please provide as much detail as possible so I can better understand the issue and provide a more informed response.

Hey,

A few thoughts:

Do you see any issues/errors if you run fly logs command?

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

    Verify the configuration of your app in the Fly app dashboard to ensure that it's set up correctly.

    Review the logs for your app in the Fly app dashboard for any error messages that might provide insight into the issue.

    Ensure that your app has the necessary resources to run. If your app is running low on memory or other resources, it may result in 503 errors.

    Try accessing your app from a different network or device to see if the issue is isolated to a specific location or connection.

And canâ€™t hurt to take a look at the metrics (you can see the graphs on their dashboard). Do they show any spikes, out-of-memory issues, or anything like that?
